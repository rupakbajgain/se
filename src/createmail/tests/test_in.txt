# Publication title: Health risks from exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation: BEIR VII phase 2
Publish Year:2006
Citation:National Academies Press, 2006
Journal:  

BEIR VII develops the most up-to-date and comprehensive risk estimates for cancer and other health effects from exposure to low-level ionizing radiation. It is among the first reports of its kind to include detailed estimates for cancer incidence in addition to cancer mortality. In general, BEIR VII supports previously reported risk estimates for cancer and leukemia, but the availability of new and more extensive data have strengthened confidence in these estimates. A comprehensive review of available biological and biophysical data supports a" linear-no-threshold"(LNT) risk modelâ€" that the risk of cancer proceeds in a linear fashion at lower doses without a threshold and that the smallest dose has the potential to cause a small increase in risk to humans. The report is from the Board on Radiation Research Effects that is now part of the newly formed Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board.

# Publication title: Closing PFAS Analytical Gaps: Inter-Method Evaluation of Total Organofluorine Techniques for AFFF-Impacted Water

Multiple poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are present in aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) used for firefighting activities. Currently, no single analytical technique provides a complete accounting of total PFASs or total organofluorine content in AFFF-contaminated samples. To provide insight into the performance of existing methods, we compared ten previously described PFAS measurement techniques. In AFFF-amended tap water, US EPA Methods 533 and 1633, adsorbable organic fluorine with particle induced gamma emission spectroscopy (AOF-PIGE) and fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance (19F-NMR) provided similar estimates of total fluorine. The total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay, suspect screening, and adsorbable organic fluorine with combustion ion chromatography (AOF-CIC) yielded estimates of total organic fluorine that were about two to three times higher than the other …

# Publication title: N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) as a Drinking Water Contaminant: A Review
Publish Year:2003
Citation:Environmental engineering science 20 (5), 389-404, 2003
Journal:  

N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a member of a family of extremely potent carcinogens, the N-nitrosamines. Until recently, concerns about NDMA mainly focused on the presence of NDMA in food,          consumer products, and polluted air. However, current concern focuses on NDMA as a drinking water contaminant resulting from reactions occurring during chlorination or via direct industrial contamination.          Because of the relatively high concentrations of NDMA formed during wastewater chlorination, the intentional and unintentional reuse of municipal wastewater is a particularly important area of concern.          Although ultraviolet (UV) treatment can effectively remove NDMA, there is considerable interest in the development of less expensive alternative treatment technologies. These alternative technologies include          approaches for removing organic nitrogen-containing NDMA precursors prior to …
