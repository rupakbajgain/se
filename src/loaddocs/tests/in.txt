Anaerobic dechlorination can require bioaugmentation of Dehalococcoides, and for BTEX, oxygen is often sparged to stimulate in situ aerobic biodegradation. We tested PFAS inhibition to TCE and BTEX bioremediation by exposing an anaerobic TCE-dechlorinating coculture, an aerobic BTEX-degrading enrichment culture, and an anaerobic toluene-degrading enrichment culture to n-dimethyl perfluorohexane sulfonamido amine (AmPr-FHxSA), perfluorohexane sulfonamide (FHxSA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), or nonfluorinated surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The anaerobic TCE-dechlorinating coculture was resistant to individual PFAS exposures but was inhibited by \u2026", "ref": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=C4nWDu4AAAAJ&citation_for_view=C4nWDu4AAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "link": "https://examplewebsite.com/txt"}
